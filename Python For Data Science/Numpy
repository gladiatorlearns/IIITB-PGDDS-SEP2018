Introduction

Welcome to this module on Python for Data Science.

  
In this module

In this module, we will be covering NumPy and Pandas that are the most used Python libraries for Data Science.

 

This module will teach you the basics of NumPy, which is the fundamental package for scientific computing in Python. NumPy consists of a powerful data structure called multidimensional arrays. Pandas is another powerful Python library that provides fast and easy data analysis platform. You will also learn about 'Data Visualisation in Python' in a separate module.

 
Pre-requisite for this Module

The students are expected to have gone through "Intro to Python" module before beginning with this module.

 
In this session

    Understand advantages of vectorised code using Numpy (over standard Python ways)
    Create NumPy arrays
        Convert lists and tuples to NumPy arrays
        Create (initialise) arrays
    Inspect the structure and content of arrays
    Subset, slice, index and iterate through arrays
    Compare computation times in NumPy and standard Python lists

 
Guidelines for coding console questions

The lectures are interspersed with coding consoles to help you practise writing Python code. You will be given a brief problem statement and some pre-written code. You can write the code in the provided space, verify your answer using test cases, and submit when you are confident about the answer.

 

Note that the coding console questions are non-graded. Some instructions for these questions are as follows:

    Ignore the pre-written code on the console. Please don't change it.
    Write your answer where you're asked to write it.

    You may run and verify your codes any number of times.

NumPy Basics

NumPy is a library written for scientific computing and data analysis. It stands for numerical python.

 

The most basic object in NumPy is the ndarray, or simply an array which is an n-dimensional, homogeneous array. By homogenous, we mean that all the elements in a NumPy array have to be of the same data type, which is commonly numeric (float or integer).
