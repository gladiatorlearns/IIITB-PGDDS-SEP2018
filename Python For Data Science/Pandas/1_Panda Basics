Introduction
Pandas is a library built using NumPy specifically for data analysis. You'll be using Pandas heavily for data manipulation, visualisation, building machine learning models, etc.

 

There are two main data structures in Pandas - Series and Dataframes. The default way to store data is dataframes, and thus manipulating dataframes quickly is probably the most important skill set for data analysis.

In this section, you will study:

The Pandas Series (similar to a NumPy array)
