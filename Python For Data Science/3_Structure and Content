Structure and Content of Arrays
It is helpful to inspect the structure of NumPy arrays, especially while working with large arrays. Some attributes of NumPy arrays are:

shape: Shape of array (n x m)
dtype: data type (int, float etc.)
ndim: Number of dimensions (or axes)
itemsize: Memory used by each array element in bytes
 

Note: At 1:11, the notebook shows rand_array[1, ] to print the first row. However, please note that this command will print the second row. For printing the first row, you need to specify the index as zero.

2D Array
Description
Create an array using list list_1 = [10,11,12,13] and list_2 = [15,12,13,14] and print the shape and dimension of the array created.
Execution Time Limit
5 seconds

import ast,sys
input_str = sys.stdin.read()
input_list = ast.literal_eval(input_str)
list_1 = input_list[0]
list_2 = input_list[1]

import numpy as np
array_1 = np.array([list_1,list_2])

print(array_1.shape)
print(array_1.ndim)


When the professor says rand_array[1, ], he says this will print the first row but it should actually print the second row.
This is a small mistake made by the professor. The command 'rand_array[1, ]' will indeed print the second row. For printing the first row, you need to use, 'rand_array[0, ]' as indexing in Python starts from zero.
