Graded Questions - III

You have already learnt about the concept of joins. You know that joins are used when data is to be retrieved from multiple tables at the same time. You learnt about inner join and outer join. MySQL also provides you with the option of joining a table with itself. Such a join is known as Self Join. It is extremely useful in case of self-referencing tables.
