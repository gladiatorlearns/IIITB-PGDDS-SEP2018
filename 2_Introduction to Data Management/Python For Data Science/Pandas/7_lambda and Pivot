Lambda function & Pivot tables
Until now, we have not made any changes or modifications to the data. In this section, we will:

Use lambda functions to create new and alter existing columns
Use Pandas pivot tables as an alternative to df.groupby() to summarise data
Lambda Functions
Say you want to create a new column indicating whether a given order was profitable or not (1/0).

You need to apply a function which returns 1 if Profit > 0, else 0. This can be easily done using the apply() method on a column of the dataframe.Creating New Column in a Dataframe
Description
Create a new column 'XY' which consist of values obtained from multiplying column 'X' and column 'Y


import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv('https://query.data.world/s/vBDCsoHCytUSLKkLvq851k2b8JOCkF')
df['XY'] = df['X']*df['Y']
print(df.head(20))

Pivot Tables
You may want to use Pandas pivot tables as an alternative to groupby(). They provide Excel-like functionalities to create aggregate tables.

Creating New Column in a Dataframe
Description
Create a new column 'XY' which consist of values obtained from multiplying column 'X' and column 'Y'.

import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv('https://query.data.world/s/vBDCsoHCytUSLKkLvq851k2b8JOCkF')
df['XY'] = df['X']*df['Y']
print(df.head(20))


Dataframe Pivot Table
Description
Group the data 'df' by 'month' and 'day' and find the mean value for column 'rain' and 'wind' using the pivot table command.


import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv('https://query.data.world/s/vBDCsoHCytUSLKkLvq851k2b8JOCkF')
df_1 = df.pivot_table(values=['rain','wind'],index=['month','day'], aggfunc='mean')
print(df_1.head(20))

Summary
To conclude, in this session, you learnt about the Pandas library which provides the various function to conduct data analysis in Python. The various topics that you learnt about are â€”

 

Pandas series and dataframes which are the basic data structures in Pandas library.
Indexing, Selecting and Subsetting a dataframe.
Merging and appending two dataframes which can be done using .merge and .concat commands.
Grouping and Summarising dataframes which can be done using groupby() to make an object then using this object to play around.
Using Pivot table function on a dataframe which are similar to pivot tables provided in M.S Excel.
In the next session, you will learn how to get data from various sources and cleaning it to use it for analysis.
