Flow of Course 1

Welcome to the course on Introduction to Data Management. This section tells about how this course is structured so that you can get an idea of what to expect in this course and the next courses.

 

Roughly, there are three main parts to the data management course; tools and languages for data analysis, storing and working with the data and useful framework to solve business problems. In the preparatory content, we have already introduced you with the tools and languages required in the domain of Data Science. You would have learnt the basics of multiple tools and languages like Python, SQL and Tableau.

 

Equipped with the basic knowledge of these tools, this course on data management will help you to dive into some advanced options used on a regular basis in data analytics. You will learn how various companies use these tools to store large amounts of data and perform various analysis on the data stored to obtain the required results.

 

Many of the modules have a large number of ungraded coding questions with the solutions in place. Make sure you're confident with writing the code as you will have some graded questions and assignments towards the end of the module.

 

With relevant business cases and multiple assessments included in it, the course thoroughly prepares you for the later stages in the program. At the end of the course, you will be asked to solve a case study which will test you and provide a brief idea about how these tools are used in the real-life applications.

 

One suggestion is that if you find the content or the assessments difficult, it will be better to use the buffer week to revisit the content as the entire course is further built on these tools.
