Introduction

Welcome to the module on ‘Linear Regression’.

 

In this module, you will start off with a quick introduction to three machine learning techniques — regression, classification, and clustering. Then, you will go deeper into one of the most important regression models in machine learning — Linear Regression.

 

You will learn primarily about the following two types of linear regression models:

    Simple linear regression

    Multiple linear regression

In this session

You will get a quick introduction to machine learning models. You will also learn about the basics of simple linear regression, how to find the best-fitted line for a model and all the various parameters associated with it.

 

The broad agenda for this session is as follows:

    Introduction to machine learning

    Supervised and unsupervised learning methods

    The linear regression model

    Residuals

    Residual sum of squares (RSS) and R² (R-squared)
