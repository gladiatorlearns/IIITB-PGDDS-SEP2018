Introduction to Machine Learning

In the previous course, you learnt data preparation, which is the third step of the CRISP-DM framework. Following the same CRISP-DM framework, now let's move to the fourth and the most interesting stage, called modelling.

Machine learning models can be classified into the following three types based on the task performed and the nature of the output:

    Regression: The output variable to be predicted is a continuous variable, e.g. scores of a student

    Classification: The output variable to be predicted is a categorical variable, e.g. classifying incoming emails as spam or ham

    Clustering: No pre-defined notion of a label is allocated to groups/clusters formed, e.g. customer segmentation 

 

You will get to know about the different types of machine learning models in the coming modules.

 

Let’s now learn about supervised and unsupervised learning methods.

So you can classify machine learning models into two broad categories:

    Supervised learning methods

        Past data with labels is used for building the model

        Regression and classification algorithms fall under this category

    Unsupervised learning methods

        No pre-defined labels are assigned to past data

        Clustering algorithms fall under this category

Mentioned below are some of the problems which are addressed either by a supervised or unsupervised learning algorithm. For each problem, identify if the task can be addressed by a supervised learning algorithm or an unsupervised learning algorithm. Assume an appropriate data set is available for your algorithm to learn from.


Supervised and Unsupervised Learning

Identify what type of problem this is.

You have the past data of two cricket teams on the performance of the teams based on different parameters and the match results. You have to predict which team will win.

Supervised learning
Feedback :

You have the data of the past few years to train your model on. Since you know the results of different games based on different performance parameters, it would be a supervised learning problem — more specifically, a classification problem since your output variable (i.e. the name of the team) is categorical.
Correct

Unsupervised learning

Supervised and Unsupervised Learning

Identify what type of problem this is.

You feed a large collection of spam emails to the learning model to identify the different sub-groups of these spam mails. No labels are presents in the data set.
Supervised learning
Feedback :
This is not a supervised learning problem since you don’t have any labels assigned to your data set to train your model on.
Incorrect
Unsupervised learning
Feedback :
This can be addressed using unsupervised learning as there are no labels assigned to your data set and they need to be identified.

Supervised and Unsupervised Learning

Identify what type of problem this is.

Consider a large data set of the medical profiles of cancer patients. This data contains no labels for the medical profiles of the cancer patients. The model has to learn whether there might be different groups of such patients for which separate treatments might be tailored.
Supervised learning
Unsupervised learning
Feedback :
This can be addressed using an unsupervised learning algorithm, in which you group patients into different clusters.
