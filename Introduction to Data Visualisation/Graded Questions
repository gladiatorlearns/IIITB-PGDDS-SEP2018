Scaling the Box Plot

Suppose you got the following plot when you plotted the boxplot in matplotlib for a given feature. As you can see, the boxplot is not readable clearly because of high values of outliers. What can be done to get a better boxplot for the same feature?

 

Transform the x-axis into the logarithmic scale

Transform the y-axis into the logarithmic scale
Feedback :

Correct

Remove the outliers from the dataset
