Cumulative Probability

In the previous example, we only discussed the probability of getting an exact value. For example, we know the probability of X = 4 (4 red balls). But what if the house wants to know the probability of getting < 3 red balls, as the house knows that for < 3 red balls, the players will lose and they will make money?

 

Sometimes, talking in less than is more useful, for example — how many employees can get to work in less than 40 minutes? Let’s explore how you can find the probability for such cases.

"Less than" Probability

Recall the UpGrad game with the red and blue balls? For this game, can you find the probability of getting 3 or fewer red balls i.e. P(X<3)?

The original probability distribution is given here -
x (Number of Red Balls)	P(x)
0	0.0256
1	0.1536
2	0.3456
3	0.3456
4	0.1296
0.8704
Feedback :
P(X<=3) = the probability of getting less than 3 red balls, i.e. 0, 1, 2, or 3 red balls . So, the required probability = P(X=0) + P(X=1) + P(X=2) + P(X=3), which evaluates to 0.0256 + 0.1536 + 0.3456 + 0.3456 = 0.8704.
Correct

Cumulative Probability

In the table below, you can see the cumulative probability distribution for the weights of a company’s employees. Based on this distribution, can you find out the probability of an employee having a weight between 60 and 65 kilograms?(Assume that P(X=60) and P(X=65) are both 0.)
x(Weight)	F(x) = P(X<x)
50	0.167
55	0.250
60	0.367
65	0.467
70	0.550
75	0.650
80	0.733
85	0.833
90	0.933
95	0.967
100	1.000

Clarification - The cumulative probability distribution table, shown in the above video (02:22 to 03:11) should be - 
x	F(x) = P(X<x)
0	0.0256
1	0.1792
2	0.5248
3	0.8704
4	1.0000

 

(Side Note:  In the question for calculating the probability of weights between 60 and 65, you might have noticed one thing that we calculated P(X ≤ 65)-P(X ≤ 60) to find P(60 ≤ X  ≤ 65). 
However, this is not entirely correct if you consider discrete distributions, because P(X=60) would also get subtracted from the value P(X<=65) when we evaluate P(X ≤ 65)-P(X ≤ 60)
The assumption that we took that both P(X=60) and P(X=65) would be equal to 0 is necessary for the calculation to hold true. However, one important concept which you'll learn further
is that the "weight" variable is generally considered as continuous and not discrete and for continuous variables, the value of P(X=x) where X is a random variable and x is a value, is always 0. Hence the logic shown in the video holds. So for cumulative distribution tables where the probabilities of individual values are not given, you can just use a similar analogy to
calculate the probability between the two values.)

 

So, the cumulative probability of X, denoted by F(x), is defined as the probability of the variable being less than or equal to x.

 

In mathematical terms, you would write cumulative probability F(x) = P(X<x). For example, F(4) = P(X<4), F(3) = P(X<3).

Cumulative Probability

Let’s define X as the number of wickets Ishant Sharma would take in the next T20 match he plays. Also, the following is an incomplete table for cumulative probability based on previous experience:
x(Number of wickets taken by Ishant Sharma in a T20 Match)	  F(x)  
0	0.35
1	0.55
2	0.75

 

What is the probability that he would take more than 2 wickets in the next  T20 match he plays?
0.75
0.25
Feedback :
You know that F(2) i.e. P(X<=2) is 0.75. Now, you have to find the probability of X being higher than 2, i.e. P(X>2). Notice that the sum of P(X<=2) and P(X>2) would be equal to 1, because their sum will cover all possible outcomes. Hence, P(X<=2) + P(X>2) = 1, which gives 0.75 + P(X>2) = 1. Hence, P(X>2) = 0.25.

Binomial Distribution

The binomial distribution describes the result of n
independent trials with probability p

. It is frequently used to model the number of successes in a specific number of identical binary experiments, such as the number of heads in five coin tosses.

This concept of cumulative probability will be used extensively in the next session, where we will talk about continuous random variables.
