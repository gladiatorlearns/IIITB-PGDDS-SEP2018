Introduction: Inferential Statistics
Welcome to the module on ‘Inferential Statistics’. In the last module on EDA, you learnt how to explore data and derive insights from its exploration.

 

In this module
Exploratory data analysis helped you understand how to discover patterns in data using various techniques and approaches. As you've learnt, EDA is one of the most important parts of the data analysis process. It is also the part on which data analysts spend most of their time.

 

However, sometimes, you may require a very large amount of data for your analysis which may need too much time and resources to acquire. In such situations, you are forced to work with a smaller sample of the data, instead of having the entire data to work with.

 

Situations like these arise all the time at big companies like Amazon. For example, say the Amazon QC department wants to know what proportion of the products in its warehouses are defective. Instead of going through all of its products (which would be a lot!), the Amazon QC team can just check a small sample of 1,000 products and then find, for this sample, the defect rate (i.e. the proportion of defective products). Then, based on this sample's defect rate, the team can "infer" what the defect rate is for all the products in the warehouses.

 

This process of “inferring” insights from sample data is called “Inferential Statistics”.

Note that even after using inferential statistics, you would only be able to estimate the population data from the sample data, but not find the exact values. This is because when you don't have the exact data, you can only make reasonable estimates about it with a limited level of certainty. Therefore, when certainty is limited, we talk in terms of probability.

Basic Definition of Probability
The probability of an event is equal to the:


Number of favourable outcomes / Number of unfavourable outcomes

Number of unfavourable outcomes / Number of total outcomes

Number of favourable outcomes / Number of total outcomes
Feedback :
Yes, this is the basic definition of probability.
Correct

Basic Definition of Probability
A regular die is thrown. The probability of getting the number 5 is:


5 / 6

1 / 6
Feedback :
Number of favourable outcomes = 1 (i.e. the outcome that the die throws 5). Total number of outcomes = 6 (The die could throw 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6). Probability = Number of favourable outcomes / Total number of outcomes = 1 / 6.
Correct

1 / 3

1 / 2

Questions:3/6
 
 
 
 
 
 
Basic Definition of Probability
A regular die is thrown. The probability of getting an even number is:


2 / 6

3 / 6
Feedback :
Number of favourable outcomes = 3 (the die throws 2, 4, 6). Total number of outcomes = 6 ( the die could throw 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6). Probability = Number of favourable outcomes / Total number of outcomes = 3 / 6
Correct

1 / 6

4 / 6

Questions:4/6
 
 
 
 
 
 
Basic Definition of Probability
Out of the following values, which is/are the possible value(s) of probability?


0.1
Feedback :
The probability of an event can only be between 0 and 1
Correct

-0.1

1.0
Feedback :
The probability of an event can only be between 0 and 1
Correct

10

Questions:5/6
 
 
 
 
 
 
Basic Definition of Probability
The probability of all possible events adds up to:


1
Feedback :
The probability of all possible events adds up to 1, as the number of favourable events becomes the total number of events.
Correct

0

Infinity

Questions:6/6
 
 
 
 
 
 
Basic Definition of Probability
A regular die is thrown. The probability of getting the number 7 is:


1 / 6

0
Feedback :
Number of favourable outcomes = 0 (you can never get a 7 by throwing a regular die). Total number of outcomes = 6 (the die could throw 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6). Probability = Number of favourable outcomes / Total number of outcomes = 0.
Correct

7 / 6

1 / 7

Advanced Concepts in Probability
A regular die is thrown. The probability of getting the number 4 or 5 in this throw is:


0

1 / 6

1 / 3
Feedback :
Define X as the number achieved after throwing the die. You know that P(X = 4) = 1 / 6 and P(X = 5) = 1 / 6. Now, using addition rule of probability, you will get that P(X = 4 or 5) = P(X = 4) + P(X = 5) = 1 / 6 + 1 / 6 = 1 / 3.
Correct

1 / 2

Advanced Concepts in Probability
A regular die is thrown. The probability of getting the number 4 in the first throw and 5 in the second throw is:


2 / 6

1 / 36
Feedback :
Again, P(getting the number 4) = 1 / 6 and P(getting the number 5) = 1 / 6. Now, using multiplication rule, you get that P(getting the number 4 in the 1st trial AND the number 5 in the 2nd trial) = P(getting the number 4 in the 1st trial)*P(getting the number 5 in the second trial) = 1 / 6 * 1 / 6 = 1 / 36.

Power Law
Please Note: This is an additional resource. The link for this session has been integrated at an appropriate place in the main EDA module.

 

You learnt that many data sets follow the phenomenon of power law. There are many real-life examples where you may find power laws being followed, such as frequency of earthquakes vs intensity of earthquakes, number of people with an income vs the income itself, etc.

 

Let us understand what causes power law.
