Confidence Interval - Example

Let’s see another example of how you can use confidence intervals to make a decision. Recall the Facebook example discussed in the last session? Let’s find the 90% confidence interval (confidence interval for 90% confidence level) for that case.

 

Recall that 50.5% of the 10,000 people surveyed preferred feature B over feature A. So, if X = the proportion of people that prefer feature B over feature A, then, for this sample, \bar{X} = 0.505 (50.5%) and n = 10,000. In addition to this, you've been told that the sample’s standard deviation S = 0.2(20%).

 

Also, you know that the actual population mean \mu lies between \bar{X} + margin of error. However, now, it's vital for us to find this margin of error.

 

If this margin of error is, say, 1%, then that would mean that the population mean \mu, which is the proportion of people that prefer feature B over feature A, lies between the range (50.5-1)% to (50.5+1)%, i.e.  49.5 % to 51.5%. It would mean that you cannot say with certainty that \mu would be more than 50%. So, even though the proportion of people that prefer feature B over feature A is more than 50% in our sample, you would not be able to say with certainty that this proportion would be more than 50% for the entire population.

 

On the other hand, if the margin of error is, say, 0.3%, then you would be able to say that the population mean lies within (50.5-0.3)% and (50.5+0.3)%, i.e. 50.2% to 50.8%. So, you would be able to say with certainty that the proportion of people that prefer feature B over feature A is more than 50% in our sample and for the entire population too.

 

Now, the margin of error corresponding to 90% confidence level would be given by \frac{Z^{*}S}{\sqrt{n}} = \frac{1.65*0.2}{\sqrt{10,000}} = 0.0033 (0.33%), and the population mean lies between 50.17% and 50.83%.


Hence, you can say that feature B should replace feature A with 90% confidence.

Mean Estimation Using CLT

For the above case, the 95% confidence interval is:
(50.11%, 50.89%)
Feedback :
From the above, you have X= 50.5%, S = 20% and n = 10,000. The confidence interval is given by (¯X−Z∗S√n,¯X+Z∗S√n), where Z* is the Z score associated with 95% confidence level = 1.96. Hence, the 95% confidence interval would be (50.5 = (50.11% to 50.89%).
Correct
(50.50%, 50.89%)
(50.11%, 50.50%)
(50.30%, 50.69%)

Mean Estimation Using CLT

For the above case, the 99% confidence interval is:
(50.24%, 50.76%)
(49.98%,51.02%)
Feedback :
From the above, you have X= 50.5%, S = 20% and n = 10,000. The confidence interval is given by (¯X−Z∗S√n,¯X+Z∗S√n), where Z* is the Z score associated with 99% confidence level = 2.58. Hence, the 99% confidence interval would be (50.5 = (49.98% to 51.02%).
Correct
(50.06%, 50.94%)
(49.82%, 51.18%)

Mean Estimation Using CLT

Now, you want to make the claim that more than 50% people prefer feature B over feature A. Which of the following statement/s about this claim is/are true?

    You can make this claim with 90% confidence

    You can make this claim with 95% confidence

    You can make this claim with 99% confidence

All of these statements are correct
Only statement 1 is correct
Only Statement 1 and 2 are correct
Feedback :
90% confidence interval for μ is (50.17%, 50.83%). Hence, with 90% confidence, you can say that more than 50% people prefer B over A. Similarly, since 95% confidence interval is (50.11%, 50.89%), you can say with 95% confidence that more than 50% people prefer B over A. However, the 99% confidence interval is (49.98%, 51.02%). Hence, at 99% confidence level, you cannot say for sure that more than 50% people prefer B over A.
Correct
