Suppose a new cancer treatment has been discovered, claiming to increase the one year survival rate for pancreatic cancer to 40%. In other words, the probability that a patient suffering from pancreatic cancer would survive for at least one year after receiving this treatment is 40%.


Suppose a  hospital is planning to use this treatment for its pancreatic cancer patients.

There are a total of 10 patients and the probability of surviving the first year is 40%, or 0.4 for each of them. Hence, the probability of 4 patients surviving is given by P(X=4)= 10C4(0.4)4(0.6)6 = 0.251 or 25.1%.

Let’s define X as the number of patients that will survive the first year after treatment. Now, according to the question, you have to find the probability of that number being less than or equal to 2, i.e. P(X<=2). You know that P(X<=2) = P(X=0) + P(X=1) + P(X=2) = 10C0(0.4)0(0.6)10+ 10C1(0.4)1(0.6)9+ 10C2(0.4)2(0.6)8= 0.167 or 16.7%

Let’s suppose that a teacher has created an assignment containing three questions, each pertaining to three different levels of difficulty. Through data collected from her previous batches of students, she has made the following table.

 
Level of Question	Normal	Intermediate	High
The probability that a randomly selected student is able to solve the question	0.85	     0.6	 0.3

 

She now gives the assignment to a group of 10 students to gather feedback.

For the high-level question, the probability that a randomly selected student is able to solve it is 0.3. We have a binomial distribution where n=10, r=2 and p=0.3 and we need to calculate P(X<=2) which is equal to P(X=0)+P(X=1)+P(X=2) = 10C0(0.3)0(0.7)10 + 10C1(0.3)1(0.7)9 + 10C2(0.3)2(0.7)8= 0.38

What is the probability that exactly 4 students are able to solve all the 3 questions?

Hint: First you need to calculate the probability that a randomly selected student is able to solve all the 3 questions.

You might observe that the probability where a student is able to solve a particular level of question has no bearing on the probability of whether the same student is able to solve any other level type of question, i.e. all the three scenarios are independent of each other. Hence using the multiplication rule of probability, you get the probability that a randomly selected student is able to solve all the three questions correctly as 0.85*0.6*0.3=0.153. This becomes the value of p and we have n=10 and we need to calculate P(X=4) which is equal to, 10C4(0.153)4(0.847)6  = 0.0425 = 4.25%.

You might observe that the probability where a student is able to solve a particular level of question has no bearing on the probability of whether the same student is able to solve any other level type of question, i.e. all the three scenarios are independent of each other. How would you use this information in calculating the probability that a randomly selected student is able to solve all the 3 questions? And then let X be the number of students who are able to solve all the questions. For the given values of n = 10 and p, you need to calculate P(X=4). Here, p would be the probability that a student is able to solve all the three questions.

Binomial Distribution

After all the 10 students attempted the test, she found that 7 students were able to solve the normal level question, 5 students were able to solve the intermediate level question and only 2 students were able to solve the high-level question. What was the theoretical probability that such a situation would have occurred?

First let us define X1, X2 and X3 as the number of students who are able to solve the normal, intermediate and high-level question respectively. Now for the given values of n and p in each case,  we calculate the theoretical probability for the three scenarios separately. This gives us P(X1 = 7)= 10C7(0.85)7(0.15)3=0.13 , P(X2 = 5)=10C5(0.6)5(0.4)5 = 0.20 and P(X3 =2)= 10C2(0.3)2(0.7)8=0.23 . Here again, the three scenarios, i.e. '7 students solving the normal level question', '5 students solving the intermediate question' and '2 students solving the high-level question' are all independent of each other. Using this information, we have the probability that all of them occurred simultaneously as 0.13*0.20*0.23 = 0.006 = 0.6 %
