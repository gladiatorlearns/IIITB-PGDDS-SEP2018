Introduction: Continuous Probability Distributions

Welcome to the session on ‘Continuous Probability Distributions’. In the last session, you learnt about the binomial distribution and the uniform distribution. Also, you learnt the concept of cumulative probability.

 
In this session

In this session, you will learn about cumulative probability in a little more depth. You will see how the probability of a continuous variable is expressed and how it is different from the way the probability of a discrete variable is expressed. You will then learn about the normal distribution, which is a commonly used probability distribution among continuous random variables.
