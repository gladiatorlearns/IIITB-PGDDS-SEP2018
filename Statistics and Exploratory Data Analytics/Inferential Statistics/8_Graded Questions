It contains the numbers 0 to 36 written in an irregular sequence. The players can bet on any number from 0 to 36. For example, let’s say that Kriti bets £100 on the number 5. Now, a ball would be dropped into the wheel, which is then given a spin. If the ball lands on the pocket marked 5, Kriti would win (£100)*36 = £3,600, resulting in net winnings of £3,600 - £100 = £3,500. However, if the ball lands on any other pocket, Kriti would not win anything, resulting in net winnings of £0 - £100 = - £100.


Let’s see what the expected value is for Kriti’s net winnings if she plays this game and bets £100 on the number 5.
