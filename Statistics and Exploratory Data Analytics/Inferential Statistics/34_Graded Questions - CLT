Graded Questions: Central Limit Theorem

Question 1

An exit poll was conducted by a news agency for the MCD (Municipal Corporation of Delhi) elections. You had been tasked with predicting the winner for ward 75N (Ashok Vihar). For that purpose, you asked 100 randomly selected voters from your ward to name the party they had voted for.

 

The data that was thus collected is given in the following table:

 
  Contesting Party  	 Mean (Percentage of Voters) 	 Standard Deviation (Percentage of Voters)
    BJP	                      58%	                           49.6%
    INC	                      42%	                           49.6%
    
    
Now, instead of taking more samples and forming a sampling distribution, which would be a tedious and expensive task, let's say you decide to use your knowledge of CLT to find the winner.


First, you would have to form a 95% confidence interval for the percentage of voters that voted for BJP. Then, you would form another such confidence interval for INC, after which you would be able to compare the two to predict the winner.

Exit Poll Confidence Interval

So, you define X as the proportion of people that voted for BJP. Now, for a 95% confidence interval, what would be the value of the MOE (margin of error)?
0.97%
9.72%
Feedback :
The margin of error = Z∗S√n. From the data given above, you know that S = 49.6% or 0.496 and n = 100. The value of Z* corresponding to 95% confidence is 1.96. So, the margin of error = 1.96∗0.496√100 = 0.0972, or 9.72%
Correct
97.2%
Feedback :
The margin of error = Z∗S√n. From the data given above, you know that S = 49.6% or 0.496 and n = 100. What value of Z* corresponds to a 95% confidence level?

Exit Poll Confidence Interval

What would the 95% confidence interval be for X, the proportion of people that voted for BJP?
(48.28%, 67.72%)
Feedback :
Recall that the margin of error = 9.72% and the sample mean ¯X = 58%. So, the confidence interval is (58%-9.72%, 58%+9.72%)
Correct
(48.28%, 58.00%)
(57.03%, 58.97%)
(53.14%, 62.86%)

Exit Poll Confidence Interval

What would the 95% confidence interval be for Y, the proportion of people that voted for INC?
(37.14%, 56.86%)
(32.27%, 42.00%)
(42.00%, 51.72%)
(32.28%, 51.72%)
Feedback :
For the variable Y, the sample mean ¯X = 42%. S, the sample’s standard deviation = 49.6% and the sample size n = 100. So, the 95% confidence interval = (¯X−Z∗S√n,¯X+Z∗S√n). Putting in the values, you get that the confidence interval is (32.28%, 51.72%).

Exit Poll Confidence Interval

Thus, with 95% confidence, you can:
Claim that BJP will win the election for ward 75N
Claim that INC will win the election for ward 75N
Not make any claims regarding the election results for ward 75N
Feedback :
The percentage of voters that voted for BJP, falls within the interval (48.28%, 67.72%). The interval for the percentage of voters that voted for INC is (32.28%, 51.72%). Hence, anything is possible. It is possible that BJP gets 67.72% of the votes and wins the election, but it is also possible that INC could get 51.72% of the votes and win the election for ward 75N. Hence, you cannot decide the winner based on this information.


So, in this way, news agencies poll people and use the data to decide the possible winner/winners for each ward. Then, they aggregate the results for all the wards and show them to us as their poll results.


The MCD elections are usually a multi-party affair but the maths in the multi-party scenario would have been very difficult to understand at present. Hence. we’ve only taken ward 75N in this example, which was contested for by only two political parties.

2 BHK Flat Rent in Powai

What is the 90% confidence interval for the monthly rent in rupees?

(₹47,999, ₹49,003)

(₹44,313, ₹46,789)

(₹44,701, ₹46,441)
Feedback :

The confidence interval, as you remember, is given by (¯X−Z∗S√n,¯X+Z∗S√n). Using Excel, you can calculate that the mean, ¯X = ₹45,571 and the standard deviation S = 7457. Also, since the sample csv file has 200 entries, sample size, n = 200. Z* value for 90% confidence level is 1.65. Putting in all the values, you get the confidence interval (₹44,701, ₹46,441).
Correct

(₹42,781, ₹44,678)

2 BHK Flat Rent in Powai

Your boss decides to fix the monthly rent at ₹46,500 and she asks you if this is close enough to the average. She asks you to decide based on a 95% confidence level.

Does the rent fixed by your boss (₹46,500) lie inside the 95% confidence interval for monthly rent?

Yes
Feedback :

The confidence interval, is given by (¯X−Z∗S√n,¯X+Z∗S√n). Also, because of previous questions, you know that the value of the mean ¯X = ₹45,571, standard deviation S = 7457 and sample size n = 200. Now, using Z* value for 95% confidence level, which is 1.96, you will get the confidence interval (₹44,537, ₹46,605). Clearly, ₹46,500 lies inside the interval.
Correct

No
