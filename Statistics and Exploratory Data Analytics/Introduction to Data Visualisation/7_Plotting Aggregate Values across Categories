Plotting Aggregate Values Across Categories

In the previous page, you were introduced to visualisations of data across categories.

 

Let's look at some more plots involving categorical data. Sometimes, we would like to see metrics such as mean, median or count of sales, profit, etc. across different categories of products. In the following video, you will see how to visualise statistical aggregates for categories. Also, you can see how you can change the type of aggregated metric while visualising the plot.

Visualising aggregates is very useful when you are preparing reports. The libraries matplotlib and seaborn have a wide range of functions to display this data in different forms.

 

Once you can make plots using statistical aggregates, you can use different plot elements and sub-plots to make detailed, insightful graphs. You can also include more than one category to group the data. Let's look at an example of this.

In the next page, we will turn our attention to visualising time-series data.

 

In addition to the plots you've learnt till now, there are a few other plots that might be useful. The links to these are provided below:
