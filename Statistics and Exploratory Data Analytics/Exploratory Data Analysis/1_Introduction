Guidelines for coding console questions

The lectures are interspersed with coding consoles to help you practise writing Python code. You will be given a brief problem statement and some pre-written code. You can write the code in the provided space, verify your answer using test cases, and submit when you are confident about the answer.

 

Note that the coding console questions are non-graded. Some instructions for these questions are as follows:

    Ignore the pre-written code on the console. Please don't change it.
    Write your answer where you're asked to write it.

    You may run and verify your codes any number of times.
