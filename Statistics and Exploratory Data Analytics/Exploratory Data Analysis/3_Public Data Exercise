Public Data Exercise

Census in India is a massive data collection exercise conducted every 10 years by the Registrar General and Census Commissioner of India (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Registrar_General_and_Census_Commissioner_of_India) under the Ministry of Home Affairs (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Home_Affairs_(India)), Government of India (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_India).

 

The latest Census was conducted in 2011 under two phases — house listing and population enumeration. The Indian Population Census, 2011 covers population characteristics such as gender, religion, education and age among other important parameters. When this data is analysed at a macro level, such as a district or a state, it presents a bigger picture which helps the government make important decisions and frame the requisite policies.

 

Census Data for 'Educational Level By Age And Sex For Population Age 7 And Above - 2011' is available here. Please download the file in column C-08 in the row corresponding to India. (http://www.censusindia.gov.in/2011census/C-series/C08.html)

 

Let’s say you are working with a central government body and want to compare the literacy rates of states in India. 

 

Your task is to understand the data (i.e. what do the rows and the attributes represent) and find the number of literates, illiterates, literacy rate etc as guided in the questions below. 

Questions:1/3
 
 
 
EDA

The merged column ‘Total’ contains three sub-columns - Persons, Males and Females. Each value in the column ‘Total-Persons’ represents the number of people in that age group, state, district etc. (state = INDIA represents aggregated information across India in each age group).  How many total people are included in the census dataset?
1210854977
Feedback :
Look at the Total-persons column in the row corresponding to all ages in INDIA. This is the first row in the dataset - the data contains literacy rates of about 121 crore people.
Correct
1290823010
1323456920
1243251298

Number of Illiterate and Literate People in India

How many total illiterate and literate people were there in India in 2011 respectively?
Illiterate = 447216165, Literate =763638812
Feedback :
These value are in the column Illiterate-Persons and Literate-Persons in the rows corresponding to 'All ages' and "INDIA'.
Correct
Illiterate = 342763892, Literate = 256638812
Illiterate = 637292612, Literate = 352962923
Illiterate = 213428639, Literate = 376297392

Literacy Rate in India

You already found the total number of illiterate and literate people in India across all ages. The literacy rate is defined as the (number of literate people aged 7 or above / total population aged 7 or above). 

What was the approximate literacy rate in India in 2011?
36%
73%
Feedback :
The total population aged 7 or above was (1210854977 - 164515253) = 1046339724; and the number of literates aged 7 or above was 763638812. The literacy rate was thus 763638812 / 1046339724 = 73% approx.
Correct
23%
77%


Summary

Let us summarise what we have learnt in the session.

We have learned two major kinds of data sources:

 

    Public data: Data collected by the government or other public agencies that are made public for the purposes of research are known as Public data.

 

    Private data: Data generated by Banking, telecom, retail, and media are some of the key private sectors that rely heavily on data to make decisions.

 

It is recommended that you keep the following data sources handy when looking for data sets.

    GitHub: Awesome Public Datasets  - https://github.com/awesomedata/awesome-public-datasets

    Open Government Data (OGD) Platform India - https://data.gov.in/

    GitHub: DataMeet - https://github.com/datameet

Data sourcing is only the first step in the process. After being sourced, the data needs to be cleaned before you can analyse it. In the next session, you will learn how to clean the data for analysis.
