Public Data Exercise

Census in India is a massive data collection exercise conducted every 10 years by the Registrar General and Census Commissioner of India (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Registrar_General_and_Census_Commissioner_of_India) under the Ministry of Home Affairs (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Home_Affairs_(India)), Government of India (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_India).

 

The latest Census was conducted in 2011 under two phases — house listing and population enumeration. The Indian Population Census, 2011 covers population characteristics such as gender, religion, education and age among other important parameters. When this data is analysed at a macro level, such as a district or a state, it presents a bigger picture which helps the government make important decisions and frame the requisite policies.
