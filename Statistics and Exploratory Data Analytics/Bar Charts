Bar Charts

Visualisations are created based on the type of data you have. If you have only dimensions or only measures in your data set, then you may find it difficult to create meaningful visualisations. Ideally, you must have both dimensions and measures in your dataset. Apart from that, you must know which combination of features (dimensions and measures) you can plot together to create the type of visualisations you want.

 

Tableau automatically selects the best visualisation technique based on the features you have selected, but it can always be changed manually.  In the following lecture, Prof. RC will explain more about the options available to you to create visually pleasing graphics and the semantics behind a bar chart. 

The only limitation you have while creating visualisations is the 2-D space available to you. However, you can leverage various other elements of Tableau, such as colour, size and shape to create interactive visualisations.  

 

To create a visualisation for a categorical and a numeric feature, a bar chart is the most preferred option. You can also create a stacked bar chart or a grouped bar chart if you want to visualise a dimension having different categories with a common quantitative variable.

 

You can also create a grouped bar chart for two quantitative and one categorical variable. A bar chart is most useful when you want to compare data across dimensions. Please watch the following lecture to learn how to create bar charts in Tableau.
