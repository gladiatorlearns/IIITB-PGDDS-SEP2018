DataCorporation is a budding data management services startup in India. It provides data organisation, data architecture, and data analytics services to its customers. A retail company called BuzzingBee Corporation Inc. Ltd. is looking for a vendor who can maintain and help get insights from its sales and related data.

 

BuzzingBee currently uses Excel files to store its data for all its stores spread across India. As there are hundreds of stores and thousands of salespersons and managers working in their stores, it becomes tedious to retrieve data from locally stored Excel files, even though the files are hosted on common servers. Also, it is difficult to assure the integrity of data since anyone may mistakenly change the values or introduce errors (e.g inserting a character in a numeric column). 

 

Therefore, the management of BuzzingBee decides to upgrade its technology to handle the data. Using this information, answer the following questions.
