String function

Write a query to change the datatype of 'bdate' column to char(20) and retrieve the month from the character field. Learn about the substring function here. Note that the date is stored in YYYY/MM/DD format.

update table employee

modify bdate char(20);

select name, substring(bdate, 6,2) as month

from employee;

alter table employee

modify bdate char(20);

select name, substring(bdate, 5,2) as month

from employee;

alter table employee

modify bdate char(20);

select name, substring(bdate, 6,2) as month

from employee;

Feedback :

Alter table command is used to alter the structure of a table. Substring works as substring(string, index, length)
Correct

Date Function

Which of the following set of SQL queries will list the employees ssn in order of their birthdays?

(List the employee whose birthday falls on January 1 before the employee whose birthday falls on January 2)

select ssn, bdate

from employee

order by extract(month from bdate) desc, extract(day from bdate);

select ssn, bdate

from employee

order by extract(month from bdate) , extract(day from bdate) desc;

select ssn, bdate

from employee

order by extract(month from bdate) , extract(date from bdate);

Looking at the address field in the employee table, you would notice that all the employees reside in "Fondren, Houston, TX". Consider the integer in the address field as house number. Consider the distance between the two houses as the difference in the house numbers, so the distance between house number 2 and 38 is 36 units. Now answer the questions given below
