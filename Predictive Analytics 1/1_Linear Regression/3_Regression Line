Intercept of a Straight Line

Since you now know about the equation of a straight line, let’s look at the general equation of a straight line which is fitted during simple linear regression.

A simple linear regression model attempts to explain the relationship between a dependent and an independent variable using a straight line.

 

The independent variable is also known as the predictor variable. And the dependent variables are also known as the output variables.

Intercept of a Straight Line

What is the intercept of the given line? Use the graph given above to answer this question.
0
3
Feedback :
The value of y when x = 0 in the given straight line is 3. So, 3 would be the intercept in this case.
Correct

Slope of a Straight Line

What is the slope of the given line? Use the graph given above to answer this question.
1/2
Feedback :
The slope of any straight line can be calculated by (y₂ - y₁)/(x₂ - x₁), where (x₁, y₁) and (x₂, y₂) are any two points through which the given line passes. This line passes (0,3) and (2, 4); so the slope of this line would be (4-3/2-0) = ½.
Correct

Equation of a Straight Line

What would be the equation of the given line?
Y = X/2 + 3
Feedback :
The standard equation of a straight line is y = mx + c, where m is the slope and c is the intercept. In this case, m = ½ and c = 3, so equation would be Y = X/2 + 3.
Correct
Y = 2X + 3
Y = X/3 + ½
Y = 3X + ½


Coefficients of Regression Line

Which statement explains the physical interpretation of the slope of the regression line Y = β₀ + β₁.X, where Y is the sales amount in crores and X is the marketing spend in lakhs?

For each additional β₁ lakh spent on marketing, the predicted sales increases by 1 crore

For each additional β₁ lakh spent on marketing, the predicted sales increases by β₀ crore
Feedback :

For this regression line, β₀ is the intercept and β₁ is the slope. For a unit increase in the quantity of X (marketing spend), what would be the increase in Y (sales amount)?
Incorrect

For each additional 1 lakh spent on marketing, the predicted sales increases by β₁ crore
Feedback :

For this regression line, β₀ is the intercept and β₁ is the slope. For a unit increase in the quantity of X (marketing spend), Y (sales amount) increases by β₁.1 = β₁ units.
Correct

For each additional β₀ lakh spent on marketing, the predicted sales increases by β₁ crore

Coefficients of Regression Line

Which statement explains the physical interpretation of the intercept of the regression line Y = β₀ + β₁.X, where Y is the sales amount in crores and X is the marketing spend in lakhs?

When the amount spent on marketing is Rs. 0, the sales amount = β₀ crore
Feedback :

For this regression line, β₀ is the intercept and β₁ is the slope. The value of Y (sales amount) is β₀ crore when the value of X (marketing spend) is Rs. 0.
Correct

When the amount spent on marketing is Rs. 0, the sales amount = β₁ crore

When the amount spent on marketing is Rs. β₀ lakh, the sales amount = 0 crore

When the amount spent on marketing is Rs. β₁ lakh, the sales amount = 0 crore
