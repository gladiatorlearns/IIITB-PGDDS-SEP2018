Cutting the Dendrogram & Analyzing the Clusters

We will use the same online retail case study and data set that we used for the K-Means algorithm. For making the customer segments this time, we will use the hierarchical algorithm.

 

We will start at the point where we are done with the data preparation and already have the RFM dataset which has been treated for missing values and outliers, and is also standardised.

 

The hierarchical clustering involves 2 basic steps:

    Creating the dendrogram
    Cutting the dendrogram at an appropriate level
    
    
    After we got the clusterIDs for each customer, we then appended the obtained ClusterIDs to the RFM data set, and analysed the characteristics of each cluster to derive the business insights from the different customer segments or clusters, in the same way as you did for the K-Means algorithm.

Now look at the following dendrogram and answer the questions that follow.

Hierarchical Clustering

Consider the above dendrogram for agglomerative clustering and answer the following questions.

 

Find number of clusters if threshold value is 10000. (refer fig)
3
4
5
Feedback :
Draw a horizontal line at that height. It cuts 5 vertical lines, all of which represent a cluster.
Correct!
7

Hierarchical Clustering

Find the threshold value if the no. of clusters to be formed is 4. (refer fig)
5000
10000
15000
Feedback :
Look at the height at which a horizontal line will cut 4 vertical lines.
Correct!
20000
Feedback :
How do you find out the number of clusters at a specific height? Try and remember cutree function.
