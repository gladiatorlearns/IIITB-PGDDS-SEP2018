K-Means algorithm

Select the correct statement among the following:
The clusters formed by k-means algorithm do not depend on the initial selection of cluster centers.
The results of k-means algorithm get impacted by outliers and range of the attributes.
Feedback :
Depending on the initial selection of centers, the formed clusters might be different. The value of k has to be decided by the user
Correct!
k-means algorithm can be applied to both categorical and numerical variables.
K-means clustering automatically selects the most optimum value of k

Choose strike rate and average as the two factors on which you will cluster the data. You don’t need to clean the data. Just scale the data using the scale command and create the clusters.

 

Pointers before you proceed:

    standardise all parameters using standard_scaler.fit_transform() and save the output to a variable before you proceed. (check the K-Means code)
    Choose random_state=100 for running K-Means in Python with SKLearn.
