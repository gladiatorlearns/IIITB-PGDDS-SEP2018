Module Introduction: Logistic Regression

Welcome to the module on ‘Logistic Regression’. In the last module on linear regression, you learnt how a linear regression model can be used to make predictions for continuous variables.

In this module

Now, in this module, you will learn logistic regression, which is a classification model, i.e. it will help you make predictions in cases where the output is a categorical variable.

 

Since logistic regression is the most easily interpretable of all classification models, it is very commonly used in various industries such as banking, healthcare, etc.

Exponentials

What is e3∗e2 equal to?
​e1​
​e5​
Feedback :
Recall that one property of exponentials is that ​ea∗eb​ is equal to ​ea+b​. Hence ​e3∗e2​ = e3+2​ = e5​
Correct
​e6​
​e9​ 
Questions:2/4
 
 
 
 
Exponentials

What is e3e2 equal to?
​e1​
Feedback :
Recall that one property of exponentials is that ​eaeb​ is equal to ​ea−b​. Hence, ​e3e2​ = e3−2​=e1​
Correct
​e5​
​e6​
​e9​

Questions:3/4
 
 
 
 
Exponentials

What is (e3)2 equal to?
​e5​
​e6​
Feedback :
Recall that one property of exponentials is that ​(ea)b​ is equal to ​ea∗b​. Hence, ​​(e3)2​ = ​e3∗2​ = ​e6​
Correct
​e8​
​e9​ 


Questions:4/4
 
 
 
 
Exponentials

What is e−2 equal to?
​−e2​
​e1/2​
1/​e2​
Feedback :
Recall that one property of exponentials is that ​e−a​ is equal to 1/​ea​. Hence, ​e−2​ = ​1/e2
Correct
None of the above

    Questions:1/4
 
 
 
 
Logarithms

If x3=y, then:
​logx3=y​
​log3x=y​
​logxy=3​
Feedback :
Recall the definition of log. If ​ab=c​, then ​logac=b​. So, if ​x3=y​, then, by definition, logxy=3​
Correct
​logyx=3​ 

Questions:2/4
 
 
 
 
Logarithms

What is log 9 + log 3 equal to?
log (93)
log (9*3)
Feedback :
Recall that one property of logarithms is that log a + log b= log (a*b). Hence, log 9 + log 3 = log (9*3) = log 27.
Correct
log (9+3)
log (39) 

Questions:3/4
 
 
 
 
Logarithms

What is log 9 - log 3 equal to?
log (9*-3)
log (9/3)
Feedback :
Recall that one property of logarithms is that log a - log b= log (a/b). Hence, log 9 - log 3 = log (9/3) = log 3.
Correct
log (9-3)
None of the Above

Questions:4/4
 
 
 
 
Logarithms

What is log(93) equal to?
(log 3)(log 9)
9 log 3
3 log 9
Feedback :
Recall that one property of logarithms is that ​log(ab)​= b log a. Hence, log(93)​ = 3 log 9.
Correct
None of the above
