Finding the Optimal Threshold

In the last segment, you saw that the ROC curve essentially shows you a trade-off between the sensitivity and specificity. But how do you find the optimal threshold in order to get a decent accuracy, sensitivity, as well as specificity? Let's hear what Rahim has to say.

So, first Rahim calculated the values of accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity at different cut-off values and stored them in a dataframe using the code below:

 

# Now let's calculate accuracy sensitivity and specificity for various probability cutoffs.
cutoff_df = pd.DataFrame( columns = ['prob','accuracy','sensi','speci'])
from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix

# TP = confusion[1,1] # true positive 
# TN = confusion[0,0] # true negatives
# FP = confusion[0,1] # false positives
# FN = confusion[1,0] # false negatives

num = [0.0,0.1,0.2,0.3,0.4,0.5,0.6,0.7,0.8,0.9]
for i in num:
    cm1 = metrics.confusion_matrix(y_train_pred_final.Churn, y_train_pred_final[i] )
    total1=sum(sum(cm1))
    accuracy = (cm1[0,0]+cm1[1,1])/total1
    
    speci = cm1[0,0]/(cm1[0,0]+cm1[0,1])
    sensi = cm1[1,1]/(cm1[1,0]+cm1[1,1])
    cutoff_df.loc[i] =[ i ,accuracy,sensi,speci]
print(cutoff_df)

 

The key takeaway from this code is the accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity values which have been calculated using the appropriate elements in the confusion matrix. The code outputted the following dataframe:

Sensitivity-Specificity Trade-off

As you can see, when the probability thresholds are very low, the sensitivity is very high and specificity is very low. Similarly, for larger probability thresholds, the sensitivity values are very low but the specificity values are very high. And at about 0.3, the three metrics seem to be almost equal with decent values and hence, we choose 0.3 as the optimal cut-off point. The following graph also showcases that at about 0.3, the three metrics intersect.
Accuracy, Sensitivity, and Specificity tradeoff

As you can see, at about a threshold of 0.3, the curves of accuracy, sensitivity and specificity intersect, and they all take a value of around 77-78%.

 

Now, as Rahim mentioned, you could've chosen any other cut-off point as well based on which of these metrics you want to be high. If you want to capture the 'Churns' better, you could have let go of a little accuracy and would've chosen an even lower cut-off and vice-versa. It is completely dependent on the situation you're in. In this case, we just chose the 'Optimal' cut-off point to give you a fair idea of how the thresholds should be chosen.

Choosing the Optimal Cut-off

Suppose you created a dataframe to find out the optimal cut-off point for a model you built. The dataframe looks like the following:
Threshold	Probability	Accuracy	Sensitivity	Specificity
0.0	0.0	0.21	1.00	0.00
0.1	0.1	0.39	0.96	0.22
0.2	0.2	0.56	0.88	0.49
0.3	0.3	0.59	0.81	0.53
0.4	0.4	0.62	0.78	0.63
0.5	0.5	0.74	0.73	0.74
0.6	0.6	0.81	0.64	0.79
0.7	0.7	0.78	0.42	0.83
0.8	0.8	0.63	0.21	0.92
0.9	0.9	0.56	0.03	0.98

 

Based on the table above, what will the approximate value of the optimal cut-off be?

0.4

0.5
Feedback :

Correct! The optimal cut-off point exists where the values of accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity are fairly decent and almost equal. At the cut-off of 0.5, the metric values are 0.74, 0.73, and 0.74 respectively. This is the optimal value of threshold that you can have. 
Correct

0.6

0.7

Choosing a model evaluation metric

As you learnt, there is usually a trade-off between various model evaluation metrics, and you cannot maximise all of them simultaneously. For e.g., if you increase sensitivity (% of correctly predicted churns), the specificity (% of correctly predicted non-churns) will reduce. 

 

Let's say that you are building a telecom churn prediction model with the business objective that your company wants to implement an aggressive customer retention campaign to retain the 'high churn-risk' customers. This is because a competitor has launched extremely low-cost mobile plans, and you want to avoid churn as much as possible by incentivising the customers. Assume that budget is not a constraint.

 

Which of the following metrics should you choose the maximise?

Accuracy

Sensitivity
Feedback :

Yes, high sensitivity implies that your model will correctly identify almost all customers who are likely to churn. It will do that by over-estimating the churn likelihood, i.e. it will misclassify some non-churns as churns, but that is the trade-off you need to choose rather than the opposite case (in which case you may lose some low churn risk customers to the competition).
Correct

Specificity
