Introduction: Univariate Logistic Regression

Welcome to the session on 'Univariate Logistic Regression'.

 
In this session

In this session, you will learn a few basic concepts related to logistic regression. Broadly speaking, the topics that will be covered in this session are:

    Binary classification

    Sigmoid function

    Likelihood function

    Building a logistic regression model in Python

    Odds and log odds

You will learn about all these concepts through a univariate logistic regression example. Also, if these terms sound a little alien to you right now, you don’t need to worry. By the time you are done with this module, you will be well-versed in the terms of odds and log odds!

Binary Classification

The most common use of logistic regression models is in binary classification problems. So, let’s hear from Prof. Dinesh what a binary classification problem is.

You can download the data set for the diabetes example from below.

Diabetes Data

Now, recall the graph of the diabetes example. Suppose there is another person, with a blood sugar level of 195, and you do not know whether that person has diabetes or not. What would you do then? Would you classify him/her as a diabetic or as a non-diabetic?
Diabetes Data

Now, based on the boundary, you may be tempted to declare this person a diabetic, but can you really do that? This person’s sugar level (195 mg/dL) is very close to the threshold (200 mg/dL), below which people are declared as non-diabetic. It is, therefore, quite possible that this person was just a non-diabetic with a slightly high blood sugar level. After all, the data does have people with slightly high sugar levels (220 mg/dL), who are not diabetics.
