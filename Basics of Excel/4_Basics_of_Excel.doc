The objective of this module is two-fold:

1) to learn the basic and advanced functionalities of Excel and

2) to learn data manipulation and analysis to solve business problems using case studies.

This module assumes no pre-requisite or prior knowledge of Excel.

The module is divided into three sessions. In the first session, you will learn how to prepare well-formatted reports using sort / filter operations and advanced formatting techniques. 


In the next two sessions, you will analyse a telemarketing business problem to find the types of customers which should be targeted. You will accomplish the same using formulae, pivot tables, visualisations,  v-lookups etc.
  

We recommend a few guidelines on how to study this module, the most important being that you should keep working along with the videos (by pausing the videos intermittently) and replicate the analysis. If you perform hands-on tasks for the entire module, you'll be surprised at how much you have learnt in a short amount of time.

Also, we recommend that you attempt the practice assignment, evaluate yourself and re-watch the lectures where you make mistakes or are not confident. A task is always done better the second time.   

In this session:
Understanding the Excel interface
Sort and Filter
Report Making: Basic and Advanced formatting 
Printing and Page Layouts
Passwords and Naming Files

Understanding the Excel Interface
Welcome to the first segment of Data Analysis in Excel. In this segment, you will understand the Excel interface and learn how to read a typical data file and the structure of the Excel interface. If you are completely new to Excel (or have minimal experience of using it), this is the place to start! 

 

In the entire first session, we will use the hospital charges  data set. You are requested to download the data file from the bottom of this page. 


But before we start analysing the dataset, let's understand what we're going to accomplish in this session. 

The Hospital Charges dataset has more than 150,000 records of treatment of various ailments in several US hospitals. Some stats about the dataset:

The dataset has a record of 100 ailments
It has a list of 3000+ healthcare providers (hospitals, medical centres, etc.)
It has data from 50 states of the USA and approximately 2000 cities across the USA
It describes the cost of treatment for approximately 7 million patients
Each record (or row) is a unique combination of state, city, ailment & provider. It also lists the average cost of treatment for a particular ailment.

 

How are we going to use this dataset?

We are going to analyse this "raw" dataset and prepare a "report" having the list of providers treating a specific ailment in a particular state of USA. Subsequently, we will rank providers by the cost of treatment.

Such a "report" will be extremely useful to government agencies and patients across the state. Instead of analysing the entire dataset, they will now use this report to find the cheapest healthcare provider in their city. Think of this report like a sorted "Yellow Pages" or "Dictionary".

 

In the process, we will learn about some tools that help in analysis like:

Sort & Filter
Conditional Formatting
We will also learn about formatting tools that make a report readable.

So, without any further delay, let's step into making this report.


Slicing and Dicing Data - Sort and Filter
The most common task people do in Excel is to search for useful data. For example, you may want to know the cheapest hospital for chest pain treatment. Or you may want to know the most expensive healthcare treatments in a particular region of the country. 

 

The sort and filter operations are meant to do these type of analyses. Sorting means to arrange the data (typically a column) in increasing, decreasing or alphabetical order. Filters, as the name suggests, enable you to filter out certain data, like all the hospitals in Alabama or all the hospitals treating chest pain. 

Remember that sorting only works when the data is in the correct format. Next, you'll learn how to sort data on multiple levels simultaneously. For example, you may want to sort all states in a country alphabetically and within each state sort all hospitals from highest to lowest cost or within each state sort hospitals alphabetically. This cannot be done by simply applying the sort twice because the second sort operation overrides the first one. 

 

You'll need to use custom sort to apply a sort operation within an already sorted range. You can also think of this as a Multi-Level Sort.

In this segment, you learnt the sort and filter operations. The key takeaways from the session are:

Searching can be done using Ctrl + F or by filtering data  
Sorting can be done on numbers (increasing / decreasing ) and characters (A-Z / Z-A)   
Sorting works only when the data is in the correct format
Custom Sort can be used to apply multi - level sort

Report Making I: Basic Formatting
Making a great report is like being a good boyfriend - you have to get lots of small things right! You have to get the numbers to the right decimal places, use colours to highlight important rows, create borders, hide unimportant columns etc.

 

In this segment, you will learn the basics of making a good report - hiding or deleting unimportant columns, freezing rows or columns for better readability, getting numbers in readable formats etc. In the process, you will also learn ways to use shortcuts so that you can save time. 

 

Note: From this segment onwards, we recommend you to create a report using the hospital charges dataset as you watch the lectures. Also, experiment with the various formatting options. 

You may have noted that small things like hiding irrelevant information, getting the right widths of columns etc. make a huge difference in the readability of the report. Next, you will learn number formatting which is basically a way to get the numbers in the right units and to the correct number of decimals. Also, pay attention to the shortcuts being mentioned and try to get habitual to them.

Getting numbers in the right formats and units makes the analysis easier and reduces the chances of mistakes when reading the data. Note that a lot of formatting operations we have discussed are not only aimed at improving readability but also to reduce the amount of time spent on reading the file. Hiding columns, formatting numbers, using shortcuts etc. are all ways to improve both readability and efficiency. 

To summarise, you learnt some tasks that make a report readable - hiding or deleting data, number formats, freezing panes etc. A few things worth remembering are:

You should only delete data when you are sure that you will never need them, else you should just hide them
To freeze rows and columns apart from the first row /column, choose the first cell inside the table formed by the rows and columns to be frozen  
 

Having learnt basic formatting, this is only the tip of the iceberg. In the next segment, you will learn conditional formatting which is a critical ingredient in making excellent reports. 

Report Making II: Conditional Formatting
Conditional formatting is a highly effective way to highlight important information and trends in the data. Using conditional formatting, you can highlight cells in certain colours and shades depending on the cell's value.  

 

In this segment, you will learn to use conditional formatting to design highly readable and beautiful reports. 

 

Another commonly used operation used for the same purpose is freezing panes, which you'll learn next.

Take a look at the following set of numbers. How many numbers greater than 90 are present in this table?



conditional formatting


If you were to actually count that, apart from taking a lot of time, the task will probably bore and / or irritate you. Now take a look at the following formatted table and count the number of cells above 90.

This will probably take you less than 5-7 seconds. Apart from simple use cases like this, conditional formatting is heavily used to highlight trends in numbers, highlighting dates of the current week in specific colours etc. 

You may have noted that conditional formatting fulfils the same dual purpose as most other formatting techniques - improve readability and reduce the amount of time required to understand important information. This is obviously a correct thing to do (because the inverse makes no sense, right?)

 

While using conditional formatting, you will have to choose between colours, formatting rules etc. Remember that anything which fulfils the above two requirements is a good formatting technique. This principle can be generalised to other formatting techniques.

 

Next, you will learn a few more tips and tricks of conditional formatting. Towards the end, we will also hear from Anand about how Conditional Formatting has helped him uncover insights from data.
