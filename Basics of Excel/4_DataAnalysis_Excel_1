Introduction

Welcome to the second session of Data Analysis in Excel. In this session, you will learn to use some powerful Excel techniques used to understand and manipulate data. The learning objectives of this session are:

    Use csv and delimited files to read data
    To understand common tricks in Data Analysis (e.g.: Bucketing & Segmenting)
    Use shortcuts while working in MS Excel
    Use formulae and Cell Referencing in MS Excel
    Create visualisations to analyse and present data / important insights 

 

This module assumes no pre-requisite knowledge of Excel and essentially builds on what you've learnt in session 1.

 
In this session:

In this session, you will take a bank's telemarketing business problem to understand the types of customers which should be targeted for future marketing campaigns. The dataset contains demographic and personal information of about 45000 people and their response to a telemarketing campaign, i.e. whether they bought a certain product when contacted by the company through telemarketing. 

 

Our objective is to find the attributes of customers who are likely to buy the product when contacted through telemarketing. This is a classic case of acquisition analytics where companies use past data to predict which customers are likely to buy certain products.   

 

The following topics will be covered in this session:

    Delimited files
    Discovering shortcuts
    Formulae in Excel
    Complex Functions
    Cell Referencing and Text Functions
    Logical Formulae
    Creating & Formatting Charts in Excel
    Choosing the right type of Chart

 
Guidelines for In-Module Questions:

The in-video and in-content questions and the assignments of this module are not graded. 

 

We suggest that you download the dataset from the end of this page and work alongside.

 Delimited Files

Delimited files are data files which have values separated by certain special characters (e.g.: Tab, Comma, Semi - Colon). They are in widespread use because they can be easily accessed by various platforms and spreadsheet software apart from Excel. Some of the most commonly used delimited file formats are:

 

    Comma Separated Values Files (CSV)
    Semi-Colon Separated File
    Tab Separated File

 

For example, the following fields in each record are separated by Semi-Colons, and each record by new lines:

 
Semi Colon Separated File Storage

 

The following image shows how the same file would look after exporting to MS Excel

 
Semi Colon Separated File - Extracted in Excel

 

In this segment, you will learn about extracting data (to MS Excel) from one type of Delimited Files - Semi Colon Separated Files. In the process, you will learn about some important functions like Text to Columns.

 

 

In the next segment, you will learn about exploring keyboard shortcuts in MS Excel. Using keyboard shortcuts will increase the speed of your analysis tremendously!
