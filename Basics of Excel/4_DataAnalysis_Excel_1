Introduction

Welcome to the second session of Data Analysis in Excel. In this session, you will learn to use some powerful Excel techniques used to understand and manipulate data. The learning objectives of this session are:

    Use csv and delimited files to read data
    To understand common tricks in Data Analysis (e.g.: Bucketing & Segmenting)
    Use shortcuts while working in MS Excel
    Use formulae and Cell Referencing in MS Excel
    Create visualisations to analyse and present data / important insights 

 

This module assumes no pre-requisite knowledge of Excel and essentially builds on what you've learnt in session 1.

 
In this session:

In this session, you will take a bank's telemarketing business problem to understand the types of customers which should be targeted for future marketing campaigns. The dataset contains demographic and personal information of about 45000 people and their response to a telemarketing campaign, i.e. whether they bought a certain product when contacted by the company through telemarketing. 

 

Our objective is to find the attributes of customers who are likely to buy the product when contacted through telemarketing. This is a classic case of acquisition analytics where companies use past data to predict which customers are likely to buy certain products.   

 

The following topics will be covered in this session:

    Delimited files
    Discovering shortcuts
    Formulae in Excel
    Complex Functions
    Cell Referencing and Text Functions
    Logical Formulae
    Creating & Formatting Charts in Excel
    Choosing the right type of Chart

 
Guidelines for In-Module Questions:

The in-video and in-content questions and the assignments of this module are not graded. 

 

We suggest that you download the dataset from the end of this page and work alongside.

 Delimited Files

Delimited files are data files which have values separated by certain special characters (e.g.: Tab, Comma, Semi - Colon). They are in widespread use because they can be easily accessed by various platforms and spreadsheet software apart from Excel. Some of the most commonly used delimited file formats are:

 

    Comma Separated Values Files (CSV)
    Semi-Colon Separated File
    Tab Separated File

 

For example, the following fields in each record are separated by Semi-Colons, and each record by new lines:

 
Semi Colon Separated File Storage

 

The following image shows how the same file would look after exporting to MS Excel

 
Semi Colon Separated File - Extracted in Excel

 

In this segment, you will learn about extracting data (to MS Excel) from one type of Delimited Files - Semi Colon Separated Files. In the process, you will learn about some important functions like Text to Columns.

 

 

In the next segment, you will learn about exploring keyboard shortcuts in MS Excel. Using keyboard shortcuts will increase the speed of your analysis tremendously!

 

 
Introduction to Formulae
In the last segment, we developed an understanding of the telemarketing dataset -

A bank contacted approximately 45,000 people for a telemarketing campaign and recorded their opinion on purchasing a new product. In this session, you will analyse the dataset to find profiles of people who should be targeted i.e. categories of people who have a higher propensity to buy the new product.

 

Why is this important?

A focused targeting will not only increase the sales of the new product but also reduce the marketing cost.

This is a fairly common analysis and a lot of you would have faced similar questions at work:

Which customers to reach out for an e-mail marketing campaign?
Which customers to target based on their demographics?
All such analysis includes bucketing/segmenting. In this session, apart from Excel skills, we will also learn about developing the analytical skills like Bucketing & Segmenting.

Remember, formulae start with an equal sign '='. Recall that:

Cells are named as a combination of the respective rows and columns i.e. the cell at the intersection of Column A and Row 2 is named as A2.
Formulae can use cell references. Copy and Pasting formulae adjust the input cells references appropriately.
Double Click on the Autofill square at the bottom right of a cell to fill an entire range. Excel is smart enough to change the input references for each cell.
 

In the next  video, you will learn about Mathematical Formulae.

Complex Functions
Recall that our primary aim is to find the types of people who are most likely to respond positively to the campaign. You can analyse various attributes like age group, marital status etc. one at a time or could automate the task to do the same thing in a fraction of seconds. In this segment, you will learn faster ways to extract the important pieces of information from the data.

 n the previous video, we observed the use of:

0 & 1 instead of No & Yes. The use of binary values (especially 0 & 1)  makes the computation of average easier. 
Remove Duplicates in the Data Tab. Remove Duplicates can be used to find only the unique values in a column.
Is there a formula that can automate the aggregation by age group and eliminate the use of filters? Let's explore

To summarize the most important things you've learnt:

You calculated the average of the response column based on the marital  column using the AVERAGEIF function; it computes the average of the response column if the marital status is married / single / divorced
You learnt how to freeze certain cells in a formula using a dollar sign; in the AVERAGEIF formula, you wanted the marital status to change but not the range of response values
Freezing cells in formulae is one of the most important skills you'll need to do in everyday analysis, so make sure to practise a bit more of that in the upcoming segments. 

Cell Referencing and Text Functions
Until now, you have analyzed one variable at a time, i.e. age, marital status etc. In reality, it is possible that a combination of variables affects the propensity of a person to buy a product. For example, it is possible that married and tertiary educated  people do not buy many banking products, but unmarried and tertiary educated ones do. 

 

In this segment, you will analyze multiple variables at a time. In the process, you'll learn text functions and a few more techniques to combine variables.

In this segment, you will analyze multiple variables at a time. In the process, you'll learn text functions and a few more techniques to combine variables. 

You can now create multiple new variables by combining two or more of the original ones, like marital-housing, gender-age group, loan-month etc. But that would create far too many new variables than you can possibly analyze and make sense out of, and so we should think of better ways to do it?

 

Excel provides the option of using PIVOT Tables which help perform such aggregation automatically. We will learn more about PIVOT Tables in the next session.
