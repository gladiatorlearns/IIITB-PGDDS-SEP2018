The objective of this module is two-fold:

1) to learn the basic and advanced functionalities of Excel and

2) to learn data manipulation and analysis to solve business problems using case studies.

This module assumes no pre-requisite or prior knowledge of Excel.

The module is divided into three sessions. In the first session, you will learn how to prepare well-formatted reports using sort / filter operations and advanced formatting techniques. 


In the next two sessions, you will analyse a telemarketing business problem to find the types of customers which should be targeted. You will accomplish the same using formulae, pivot tables, visualisations,  v-lookups etc.
  

We recommend a few guidelines on how to study this module, the most important being that you should keep working along with the videos (by pausing the videos intermittently) and replicate the analysis. If you perform hands-on tasks for the entire module, you'll be surprised at how much you have learnt in a short amount of time.

Also, we recommend that you attempt the practice assignment, evaluate yourself and re-watch the lectures where you make mistakes or are not confident. A task is always done better the second time.
