Data Preparation in Tableau

Once the data is imported into Tableau, it must be prepared i.e. the data must be converted to the correct format and any discrepancies within the data must be removed. You have already seen how to do some basic data preparation activities in Tableau, like converting data types etc. In addition to those basic data preparation tasks, you might have to extract information out of the current features by making new features. In the following lecture, Prof RC will take you through the concept of splitting, a very handy option in Tableau when creating new features.

 normal split is carried out on a column of the data if the delimiter (the symbol on which the split is performed) is common and present in all the rows of that column. If not, a custom split will be carried out.

 

Sometimes, instead of extracting new information, you might want to group on or aggregate on some data. This can be done in Tableau using an option called pivot, which is also available to you in Excel. Please watch the lectures below to learn more about data preparation in Tableau:
