Tree Maps

A categorical variable, when used in the Marks Card to display colour or shape, uses distinct colours and shapes based on the distinct categories of the dimension variable. But when a measure is used to display colour, it uses different shades of the same colour to represent that measure. In such a case, the colour intensity is directly proportional to the values of the measure. In Tableau, you can plot two quantitative variables that are related to a categorical variable in ways other than a scatter plot. In this lecture, Prof. RC will discuss one such technique:

A scatter plot graph plots the quantitative variables against each other and then brings in the colour aspect of the categorical variable as distinct colours. A tree map, on the other hand, plots the quantitative variables for each category of the dimension. The values of the quantitative variables are represented by the size and the colour intensity of the plot. A tree map can only accommodate two measures, one to control the size and one to control colour, but it can accommodate any number of dimensions, as that would only increase the number of rectangles in the map.
