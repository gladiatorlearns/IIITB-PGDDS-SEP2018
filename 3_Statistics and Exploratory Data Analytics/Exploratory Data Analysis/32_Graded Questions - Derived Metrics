Graded Questions

Let’s say you work as an analyst at UpGrad and you want to find interesting patterns in ‘the typical dates and times when UpGrad students submit their assignments’.

 

The data set provided below contains information on the dates and times of students’ submissions of an assignment. It has two variables — “submission” (the unique URL of a student’s submission on the platform) and “submit_time” (the date-time of submission).

This was the Association Rule Mining assignment whose submission deadline was Jan 3, 2017 - 11:59:59 PM. The second deadline was Jan 9, 2017 - 11:59 PM. Submissions between the first and the second deadline attract a 30% penalty in marks.

 

The variable ‘submission’ has several components separated by slashes. The last component contains the submitted filename in the format ‘roll_number.xxx’ where xxx is the file extension (.zip, .R etc.)

 

You want to understand:

    The typical dates when students submit assignments

    The typical times (hour of the day) of submissions

 

Extract all the relevant metrics (such as the date, day, month, year, hour, and minutes) of each person’s submission and attempt the following questions.

Correct

Most people submit the assignment in the afternoon (i.e. 12 noon - 4 PM)

Most people submit the assignment in the morning (i.e. 8 AM -11 AM)
