Graded Questions

Letâ€™s say you work at a central government body and want to compare the literacy rates of people across all the states in India. Your task is to understand the meanings of the rows and the attributes and find the number of literates, illiterates, literacy rate, etc. You have already downloaded the Census Data for the data sourcing exercise. In case you have not downloaded yet, do so from the link below before attempting the following questions.

2011 Census Data

Open the file in Excel and try to understand the column names. For this exercise, you will only need the following columns:

    C1-C4: The first four columns are self-explanatory

    C5: Total/Rural/Urban population

    C6: Age group (e.g. age- group = 7 would mean the number of people of age 7 in each column)

    C7-C9: Total population in that row

    C10-C12: Illiterate population in that row

    C13-C15: Literate population in that row
    
     

Delete the top few rows to convert it into a standard format with appropriate column names (you may have to rename some columns manually). Then, convert the file into a CSV and import into Python. Answer the following questions.
