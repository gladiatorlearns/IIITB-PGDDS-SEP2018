Module Summary

Exploratory data analysis helps you, as a data analyst, to look beyond the data. It is a never ending process â€” the more you explore the data, the more insights you get. Almost 80% of the time, you would spend your time as a data analyst understanding the data and solving various business problems through EDA. If you understand EDA properly, then half the battle is won.

 

So far in this module, you have learnt the five most crucial topics for any kind of analysis. They are as follows:

    Understanding domain

    Understanding data and preparing it for analysis

    Univariate analysis and segmented univariate analysis

    Bivariate analysis

    Deriving new metrics from the existing data
