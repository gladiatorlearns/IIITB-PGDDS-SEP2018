Estimating Mean Using CLT

Now that you have gone through the mid-session summary, let’s get back to rest of the session. Earlier, we tried to estimate the mean commute time of 30,000 employees of an office by taking a small sample of 100 employees and finding their mean commute time. This sample’s mean was \bar{X} = 36.6 minutes and its standard deviation was S = 10 minutes.

 

Recall that we also said that the population mean, i.e. daily commute time of all 30,000 employees \bar{X} = 36.6 (sample mean) + some margin of error.

 

If you remember, you did not learn exactly how to find this margin of error. But now, you can find it by using CLT (central limit theorem). Now that you know CLT, let’s see exactly how you can do this.

Mean Estimation using CLT

What is the probability that the sample mean that we have got (¯X = 36.6 mins), is within the range - (μ - 2) mins to (μ + 2) mins? (Report the answer as a number rounded to two digits after the decimal point)

Mean Estimation Using CLT

For the given data, ¯X = 36.6, S = 10 and n = 100. What is the confidence level associated with the claim that the average commute time of the employees is between (36.6 - 1.65) and (36.6 + 1.65)?

P(36.6 - 1.65 < μ < 36.6 + 1.65) is, as you saw earlier, the same as P(μ - 1.65 < 36.6 < μ + 1.65). So basically, you have to find the probability of getting a value 1.65 standard deviations away from the mean. This would be equal to P(Z<1.65) - P(Z<-1.65) = 0.95 - 0.05 = 0.90

Mean Estimation Using CLT

For the given data, ¯X = 36.6, S = 10 and n = 100. What is the confidence level associated with the claim that the average commute time of the employees is between (36.6 - 2.58) and (36.6 + 2.58)?

P(36.6 - 2.58 < μ < 36.6 + 2.58) is, as you saw earlier, the same as P(μ - 2.58 < 36.6 < μ + 2.58). So basically, you have to find the probability of getting a value 2.58 standard deviations away from the mean.

P(36.6 - 2.58 < μ < 36.6 + 2.58) is, as you saw earlier, the same as P(μ - 2.58 < 36.6 < μ + 2.58). So basically, you have to find the probability of getting a value 2.58 standard deviations away from the mean. This would be equal to P(Z<2.58) - P(Z<-2.58) = 0.995 - 0.005 = 0.99.


So, to summarise, let’s say you have a sample with sample size n, mean \bar{X} and standard deviation S. Now, the y% confidence interval (i.e. the confidence interval corresponding to y% confidence level) for \mu would be given by the range:

Confidence interval = (\bar{X}-\frac{Z^{*}S}{\sqrt{n}}, \bar{X}+\frac{Z^{*}S}{\sqrt{n}}),

 

where, Z* is the Z-score associated with a y% confidence level. In other words, the population mean and sample mean differ by a margin of error given by \frac{Z^{*}S}{\sqrt{n}}.

 

Some commonly used Z* values are given below:

At this point, it is important to address a very common misconception. Sampling distributions are just a theoretical exercise and you’re not actually expected to make one in real life. If you want to estimate the population mean, you will just take a sample. You will not create an entire sampling distribution.

 

You must be wondering — if this the case, then why did you study sampling distributions? To understand the reason for this, let's go through the actual process of sampling. Recall that you are doing sampling because you want to find the population mean, albeit in the form of an interval. The three steps to follow are as follows:

    First, take a sample of size n

    Then, find the mean \bar{X}} and standard deviation S of this sample

    Now, you can say that for y% confidence level, the confidence interval for the population mean \mu, is given by (\bar{X}-\frac{Z^{*}S}{\sqrt{n}}, \bar{X}+\frac{Z^{*}S}{\sqrt{n}})

 

However, as you may have seen in the video above, you cannot finish step 3 without CLT. CLT lets you assume that the sample mean would be normally distributed, with mean \mu and standard deviation \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}} (approx. \frac{S}{\sqrt{n}}). Using this assumption, it becomes possible to find many things such as margin of error, confidence interval, etc.


Hence, you learnt sampling distributions so that you could learn more about CLT and hence be able to make all the assumptions as stated above.


What is the difference between Z* and Z-score?

Z-score is the value associated with a particular cumulative probability whereas Z* is the Z-score associated with a particular confidence level. If someone asks, what is the Z-score associated with 0.95 or 95%  probability, you just have to look up the table and find the corresponding value associated with it. In this case, it would come up as  1.65(or 1.645 to be more exact). However if someone asks you what is the Z* for 95% confidence level, then first you need to find the corresponding cumulative probability associated with that confidence level.  This can be easily calculated with the following formula: if y is the confidence level in percentage then the probability is given as y/100 +(1-y/100)/2. Thus for y=95, we have the probability as 95/100+(1-95/100)/2= 0.975. And the Z-score associated with 0.975 probability is 1.96. You can verify the rest of the values given above with this formula.
