Let’s say you get a job as a senior analyst at a food regulatory body such as the FSSAI. One of your tasks is to check if the amount of lead content in certain food products is within the permissible limit.

 

Recently, the company Kwick Foods filed a complaint against Sunshine, its competitor, that Sunshine’s ready-to-cook pasta contains excess quantities of lead.


Suppose you take 10 random pasta packets from the market and get it tested for the amount of lead. It just so happens that you have picked out packets from a very defective batch, and there is a 5% (or 0.05) probability that any pasta packet you select is going to be defective.

Feedback :
Let’s define X as the number of pasta packets found to be defective after testing 10 packets. Then, X would follow a binomial distribution with n = 10 and p = 0.05, the probability of finding a defective packet. Now, the probability asked in the question becomes P(X=2)= 10C2(0.05)2(0.95)8 = 0.0746, or 07.46%.

Discrete Probability Distributions

What is the probability that, after testing these 10 packets, not more than 2 packets would turn out to be defective?

Feedback :
If X is defined as the number of pasta packets found to be defective after testing 10 packets, then X would follow a binomial distribution with n = 10 and p = 0.05. So, the probability asked in the question becomes P(X<=2) = P(X=0) + P(X=1) + P(X=2) = 10C0(0.95)10+ 10C1(0.05)1(0.95)9+ 10C2(0.05)2(0.95)8 = 0.5987 + 0.3151 + 0.0746 = 0.9884, or 98.84%.

Discrete Probability Distributions

Let’s define X as the number of packets found to be defective after the 10 packets have been tested. What will be the expected value of X?

(Hint: You can Use Excel or R for the calculations for this part. Use "COMBIN(n,r)" in Excel and "choose(n,r)" in R to find nCr)

Feedback :
If X is defined as the number of pasta packets found to be defective after testing 10 packets, then X would follow a binomial distribution with n = 10 and p = 0.05. Now, you want to find the expected value, which would be equal to EV(X) = 0*P(X=0) + 1*P(X=1) + 2*P(X=2) + 3*P(X=3) + 4*P(X=4) + 5*P(X=5) + 6*P(X=6) + 7*P(X=7) + 8*P(X=8) + 9*P(X=9) + 10*P(X=10). Using a spreadsheet to calculate the individual probabilities, you can find that the expected value EV(X) = 0.5
