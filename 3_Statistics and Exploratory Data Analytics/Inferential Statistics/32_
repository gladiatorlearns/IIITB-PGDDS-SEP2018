Summary: Central Limit Theorem - Part II

First, you learnt how, using your knowledge of CLT, you can infer the population mean from the sample mean.

 

We estimated the mean commute time of 30,000 employees of an office, by taking a sample of 100 employees, finding their mean commute time, and estimating based on that value. Specifically, you were given a sample with sample mean ¯X = 36.6 minutes, and sample standard deviation S = 10 minutes.

 

Using CLT, you concluded that the sampling distribution for mean commute time would have:

    Mean = μ {unknown}
    Standard error = σ√n≈S√n=10√100=1
    Since n(100) > 30, the sampling distribution is a normal distribution

 

Using these properties, you were able to claim that the probability that the population mean μ lies between 34.6 (36.6-2) and 38.6 (36.6+2), is 95.4%.

 

Then, you learnt some terminology related to the claim:

    The probability associated with the claim is called confidence level (here, it is 95.4%)
    The maximum error made in sample mean is called margin of error (here, it is 2 minutes)
    Final interval of values is called confidence interval [here, it is the range (34.6, 38.6)]

 

Then, you generalised the whole process. Let’s say you have a sample with sample size n, mean \\bar{X} and standard deviation S. You learnt that the y% confidence interval (i.e. confidence interval corresponding to y% confidence level) for \\mu will be given by the range:

Confidence interval = (\\bar{X}-\\frac{Z^{*}S}{\\sqrt{n}}, \\bar{X}+\\frac{Z^{*}S}{\\sqrt{n}})

 

Where, Z* is the Z-score associated with a y% confidence level.
