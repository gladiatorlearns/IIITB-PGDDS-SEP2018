Summary
So what did you learn in this session?

 

T-distribution:
A T-distribution is used whenever the standard deviation of the population is unknown
The degrees of freedom of a T-distribution is equal to sample size n - 1
For sample size ≥ 30, the T-distribution becomes the same as the normal distribution
The output values and results of both t-test and z-test are same for sample size ≥ 30
 
Two-sample mean test - paired:
It is used when your sample observations are from the same individual or object
During this test, you are testing the same subject twice
 
Two-sample mean test - unpaired:
During this test, you are not testing the same subject twice
It is used when your sample observations are independent
 

Two-sample proportion test:

It is used when your sample observations are categorical, with two categories

It could be True/False, 1/0, Yes/No, Male/Female, Success/Failure, etc. 
 

A/B Testing:

A/B testing is a direct industry application of the two-sample proportion test

It is a widely used process in digital companies in the ecommerce, manufacturing and advertising domains

It provides a way to test two different versions of the same element and see which one performs better
