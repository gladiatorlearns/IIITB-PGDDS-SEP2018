Introduction
In the previous sessions, you learnt about the basic concepts of hypothesis testing and learnt how to statistically test the inferences made from inferential statistics or the insights generated during EDA. You learnt how to formulate the hypotheses and then make a decision through either the critical value method or the p-value method.

 

In this session
You will learn how hypothesis testing is used in the industry and how the basic concepts learnt in the previous session form an important foundation of useful industry concepts such as A/B testing.

 

We will cover the following topics in this session:

T distribution

Two-sample mean test

Two-sample proportion test

A/B testing

Industry relevance
