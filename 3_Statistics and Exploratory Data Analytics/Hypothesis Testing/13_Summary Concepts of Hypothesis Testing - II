Summary
So what did you learn in this session?

 

Making a decision - p-value method:
Calculate the value of Z-score for the sample mean point on the distribution

Calculate the p-value from the cumulative probability for the given z-score using the z-table

Make the decision on the basis of the p-value with respect to the given value of α (significance level)

 

Types of errors:
Type-I error    - Occurs when you reject a null hypothesis even when it is true
                          - Its probability is represented by α

Type-II error   - Occurs when you fail to reject the null hypotheses even though it is false

                                   - Its probability is represented by β
