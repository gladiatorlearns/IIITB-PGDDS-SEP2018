Understanding Hypothesis Testing
In the last two modules, you learned about the following topics:

Exploratory data analysis: Exploring data for insights and patterns

Inferential statistics: Making inferences about the population using the sample data

 

Now, these methods help you formulate a basic idea or conclusion about the population. Such assumptions are called “hypotheses”. But how do you really confirm these conclusions or hypotheses?

Let’s understand the basic difference between inferential statistics and hypothesis testing.

 

Inferential statistics is used to find some population parameter (mostly population mean) when you have no initial number to start with. So, you start with the sampling activity and find out the sample mean. Then, you estimate the population mean from the sample mean using the confidence interval.

 

Hypothesis testing is used to confirm your conclusion (or hypothesis) about the population parameter (which you know from EDA or your intuition). Through hypothesis testing, you can determine whether there is enough evidence to conclude if the hypothesis about the population parameter is true or not.

 

Both these modules have a few similar concepts, so don’t confuse terminology used in hypothesis testing with inferential statistics.

Questions:1/1
 
Nature of hypotheses
Which of the following is true about the two hypotheses that were just stated?


Exactly one hypothesis must be true
Feedback :
Both the hypotheses oppose each other, so only one of the two can be true.
Correct

Both hypotheses must be true

It is possible for neither hypothesis to be true

It is possible for both hypotheses to be true

Null and Alternate Hypotheses
The hypothesis you are trying to prove during hypothesis testing is the:


Null Hypothesis
Incorrect

Alternate Hypothesis
Feedback :
The null hypothesis is the status quo, i.e. the already existing situation. The alternate hypothesis is what you are trying to prove.

Null and Alternate Hypotheses
Government regulatory bodies have specified that the maximum permissible amount of lead in any food product is 2.5 parts per million or 2.5 ppm.

If you conduct tests on randomly chosen Maggi Noodles samples from the market, what would be the null hypothesis in this case?


The average lead content is equal to 2.5 ppm

The average lead content is less than or equal to 2.5 ppm
Feedback :
The null hypothesis is the status quo, i.e. the average lead content is within the allowed limit of 2.5 ppm.
Correct

The average lead content is more than or equal to 2.5 ppm

Null and Alternate Hypotheses
Government regulatory bodies have specified that the maximum permissible amount of lead in any food product is 2.5 parts per million or 2.5 ppm.

What would be the alternate hypothesis in the same case, when you conduct tests on randomly chosen Maggi Noodles samples from the market?


The average lead content is equal to 2.5 ppm

The average lead content is more than 2.5 ppm
Feedback :
The alternate hypothesis is the opposite of the null hypothesis. Since the null hypothesis is that the average lead content is less than or equal to 2.5 ppm, the alternate hypothesis would be that the average lead content is more than 2.5 ppm.
Correct

The average lead content is more than or equal to 2.5 ppm
 

Let’s get started by understanding the basics of hypothesis testing.

Hypothesis Testing starts with the formulation of these two hypotheses:

Null hypothesis (H₀): The status quo

Alternate hypothesis (H₁): The challenge to the status quo

Questions:1/2
 
 
Null and Alternate Hypotheses
In the Maggi Noodles example, if you fail to reject the null hypothesis, what can you conclude from this statement?


Maggi Noodles contain excess lead

Maggi Noodles do not contain excess lead
Feedback :
The null hypothesis is that the average lead content is less than or equal to 2.5 ppm. Since you fail to reject the null hypothesis, you can conclude that Maggi Noodles do not contain excess lead. Please note than you can only fail to reject the null hypothesis, you can never accept the null hypothesis.

Types of Hypotheses
The null and alternative hypotheses divide all possibilities into:


2 sets that overlap

2 non-overlapping sets
Feedback :
Both the null and alternate hypotheses can’t be true at the same time. Only one of them will be true.
Correct

2 sets that may or may not overlap

As many sets as necessary to cover all possibilities
