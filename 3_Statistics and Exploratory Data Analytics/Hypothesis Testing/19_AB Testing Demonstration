A/B Testing Demonstration
Let’s now learn from Ankit Jain about a process that is widely used in digital and online companies — A/B testing. A/B testing is a direct industry application of the two-sample proportion test sample you have just studied.

While developing an e-commerce website, there could be different opinions about the choices of various elements, such as the shape of buttons, the text on the call-to-action buttons, the colour of various UI elements, the copy on the website, or numerous other such things.

 

Often, the choice of these elements is very subjective and is difficult to predict which option would perform better. To resolve such conflicts, you can use A/B testing. A/B testing provides a way for you to test two different versions of the same element and see which one performs better. You can read more about A/B testing from this link.

You can see a few more case studies and applications of A/B testing in the real world here.

The two-sample proportion test is used when you want to compare the proportions of two different samples. Let’s now see how A/B testing is entirely based on the two-sample proportion test, and go through an Excel demonstration of A/B testing with Deepak.

You can use various other tools also to conduct A/B testing, like R, Optimizely etc.

A/B Testing
Of the 2 options, which one do you think attracted more form completion?

Option A30%
Option B

Questions:1/1
 
A/B Testing Demonstration
618 out of 2,620 people filled the application using the old feature, which makes it 23.59% conversions in the control group. 601 out of 2,380 people filled the application using the new feature, which makes it 25.25% conversions in the variation group.

 

What can you conclude about the new feature through this data of A/B testing?


The new feature is better than the old feature


The new feature is better or as good as the old feature


The new feature is not better than the old feature


Nothing can be concluded by just looking at this data
Correct
Feedback :
The number of conversions is more in case of the new feature. But there needs to be some statistical difference between the two values to arrive at a conclusion about this test, which would depend upon the significance level you choose. So, you cannot conclude anything just from this data.

A/B Testing Demonstration
The p-value you get for this one-tailed A/B testing data is 0.091. What can you conclude about this test at a 5% significance level?


Reject the null hypothesis (the new feature is better than the old feature)

Fail to reject the null hypothesis (the old feature is better or as good as the new feature)
Feedback :
You can make a decision on a test based on the p-value and the significance level of the test. As the p-value (0.091) is greater than the significance level (0.05), you fail to reject the null hypothesis. In this example of A/B testing, the null hypothesis is that the old feature is better or as good as the new feature.
Correct

Nothing can be concluded just from this data alone
