Scaling the Box Plot

Suppose you got the following plot when you plotted the boxplot in matplotlib for a given feature. As you can see, the boxplot is not readable clearly because of high values of outliers. What can be done to get a better boxplot for the same feature?

Refer Box plot graded question png in the same folder.

Transform the x-axis into the logarithmic scale

Transform the y-axis into the logarithmic scale
Feedback :

Transforming the y-axis to a logarithmic scale will make the plot much more readable.
Correct

Remove the outliers from the dataset

We cannot get a more readable plot

Scatter plot

The following scatter plot was plotted using seaborn for 'Sales' vs 'Profit' from the dataset 'df'. Suppose that you want to find out the data points for which the sales were less than 15,000 and that made a loss. Which of the following codes will achieve this?

 Refer - Scatter Plot graded question png

df = df[(df.Profit < 0) & (df.Sales < 15000)]

sns.jointplot('Sales', 'Profit', df)
plt.show()
Feedback :

We want the data points that made a loss and for which the sales were less than 15,000. The above command with an '&' between the two conditions achieves this. 
Correct

df = df[(df.Profit < 0) | (df.Sales < 15000)]

sns.jointplot('Sales', 'Profit', df)
plt.show()

df = df[(df.Profit > 0) & (df.Sales < 15000)]

sns.jointplot('Sales', 'Profit', df)
plt.show()

df = df[(df.Profit < 0) | (df.Sales > 15000)]

sns.jointplot('Sales', 'Profit', df)
plt.show()

Correlation using heatmap

What is the highest value of correlation between two variables as observed from the following heatmap?

 

1

0.79
Feedback :

As we can see from the heatmap, 'Close_qt' and 'Close_et' are most correlated with the value 0.79.
Correct

0.73

0.38
