Introduction

Until now, you have learnt to use the tools for data analysis and have understood how data is stored in organisations. This module marks an inflection point where you will learn how to solve business problems using data analysis.

 

Analytics problem solving involves multiple steps like data cleaning, preparation, modelling, model evaluation etc. Completing a typical analytics project may take several months, and thus it is important to have a structure for it. 

 

The structure for analytics problem solving is called the CRISP-DM framework - Cross Industry Standard Process for Data Mining. 

 
In this session

You will understand why a framework is extremely useful to solve business problems, how it is used and the common pitfalls people face in the process. It is a 6-step process which starts with thoroughly understanding the business problem and ends at model building, evaluation and deployment.
