# Look at structure of mtcars
str(mtcars)

# Store mtcars in a new dataframe called cars. 
cars <- mtcars

# Calculate each car's score in a new column named score 
# score = mpg.hp / wt


# Store the scores in a vector s


# Create a new vector named performance equal to the length of the vector s
# http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22104774/how-to-initialize-a-vector-with-fixed-length-in-r


# If score < mean(score), performance is 'average', else performance is 'good'


# Add the performance vector as a column to cars


# Convert the performance variable to factor type


# Summarise the cars df
