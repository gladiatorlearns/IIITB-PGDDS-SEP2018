Pattern Matching with Wildcards

Pattern matching is an important concept in the string or text-based processing. In SQL, certain characters are reserved as wildcards that can match any number of preceding or trailing characters.
select essn, hours
from works_on
where hours between 25 and 30;


Basics of Sorting
Sorting and ordering is a common operation which you have already learnt to do in Excel and R. In SQL, sorting is done using the clauses 'asc' and 'desc' for ascending and descending order respectively. You will also learn to use the IN, NOT IN and IS NULL clauses.
